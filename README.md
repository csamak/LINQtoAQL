LINQToAQL
=========

LINQ to AQL is a .NET client library and LINQ provider for [AsterixDB](http://asterixdb.ics.uci.edu/).

LINQ to AQL supports querying AsterixDB by generating [AQL](http://asterixdb.ics.uci.edu/documentation/aql/manual.html) (Asterix Query Language) expressions.

The project is currently pre-release. Later, this document will contain usage instructions and examples. For now, more fine-grained documentation is available on the project's [wiki](https://github.com/csamak/LINQToAQL/wiki).
